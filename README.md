## E-mail credentials
I created a dedicated Gmail account to send e-mails. The password is in plain text in the code, but the account is not linked to my personal information. If a malicious actor takes control of the account, I am not liable or responsible, and I have no way to reclaim the account. Any users of this application shall understand the risks associated.

The account name is `mtgspoilernotifier@gmail.com`.
